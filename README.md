# HP-invisible-cloak
Inspired by Harry Potter's invisibility cloak! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®
This project creates an invisibility cloak effect using OpenCV and Python. The effect is achieved by detecting a specific color in real-time and replacing it with a pre-captured background.
Features- 
1. Captures the background before the effect starts.
2. Detects a specific color (e.g., blue) in real-time.
3. Replaces the detected color with the background, creating an invisibility effect.
4. Runs on a webcam and allows live interaction.
